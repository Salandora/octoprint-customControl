# Plugin for OctoPrint - makes Custom Controls editable via settings
==================================================================

This plugin helps you create, edit and delete your custom controls.
You can easly access all the options in the settings under customControl.

Right-Click on a Control or the Green box to open a context menu.

By using the container elements you can easly position the controls where you want.

## Setup

Install the plugin like you would install any regular Python package from source:

    pip install https://github.com/Salandora/octoprint-customControl/archive/master.zip
    
Make sure you use the same Python environment that you installed OctoPrint under, otherwise the plugin
won't be able to satisfy its dependencies.
